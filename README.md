# Hitokori
Hitokori ( fire and ice ) is a custom [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) ruleset based on `A Dance of Fire and Ice`. Click and hold to the rhythm to watch the dance unfold!

# Features
Hitokori offers a variety of mods to spice up gameplay. Most of them are the same ones you'd exect from any other game mode, the unique ones are:
* `Hold Tiles` - Adds tiles you need to hold
* `Spin tiles` - Adds tiles that you have to press multiple times at the same speed
* `Reverse Spin` - Makes the whole playfield spin
* `Triplets` - Play with 3 orbitals

# Installing the gamemode
Open up osu!lazer and go into settings. On the very top, there is a big blue button with "Open osu! folder". In that folder, there is another one called "rulesets". Go into Hitokori releases, download the prebuilt `.dll` file and paste it there. Restart osu!lazer and you're done!

Note that the ruleset does not automatically update with osu!, you need to overwrite the `.dll` file each time you want to update Hitokori.
